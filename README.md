# FencingPoolAndScore_AndroidApp
A fencing scorekeeper that also generates pools I made in the summer of 2020 (when I was a rising high school senior) using Android Studio.

This was my first actual CS project so I didn't comment it when I finished, but I just looked over it and the function and variable names are pretty specific so there's that.

If you actually want to download the app, you can find it on the Google Play Store. It's called Fencing Pool And Score.
